# Who am I?
My name is Marshawn Judge. I'm a guy who really enjoys computers. Since 2020, I have been interested in computers, which later became an interest in cybersecurity. Throughout this time, I have taken on small and interesting projects related to computer science and cybersecurity, but I have never really committed to or documented my journey. Over the years, I have had time to deepen my interest and knowledge on technical topics. Which brings us to the purpose of this site...

## What's the point of this?
This site serves as a platform to showcase my knowledge and document my journey of learning new things. It motivates me to take on interesting projects, share my progress, and demonstrate my skills as I continue to grow. I am excited about learning new things and where this journey will take me.

## What I'll Work On
* Cybersecurity labs and write-ups

* Programming projects (Python, scripting, etc.)

* Networking and systems experiments

* Mistakes, lessons learned, and improvements

## Purpose
I am not only doing these projects to be able to show off but also to strengthen my foundations.
### Goals:
* Develop practical blue team & offensive skills
* Practice writing and documentation
* Prepare for future careers
* Discover more interest in the fields
* And most importantly, **HAVE FUN**
